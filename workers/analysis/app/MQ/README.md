This is a helper repository for the [DreamCatcher](https://github.com/martinambrus/DreamCatcher/) project.
On its own, it provides functionality for the BullMQ client. However, this project does not contain any code that you can run. You can only build upon the foundation of it.

This repository also helps to keep the code in all of the microservices using a message queue up to date with latest changes and fixes.
