This is a helper repository for the [DreamCatcher](https://github.com/martinambrus/DreamCatcher/) project containing utility functions used thorough the project. It doesn't do anything on its own.

It also helps to keep the code in all of the microservices using this repository up to date with latest changes and fixes without the need to update code in each of them separately.
